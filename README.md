Project Title: SnapShop AI

Description:

SnapShop AI is a smart shopping assistant that revolutionizes the daily shopping experience by leveraging the power of Google's generative AI and Firebase. In a world of overwhelming choices and time-consuming comparisons, SnapShop AI acts as a personal, conversational guide to simplify everything from grocery planning to finding the perfect gadget.

Users can visually search for products by snapping a photo, get intelligent recommendations through a natural language chat interface, and automatically create categorized shopping lists for any occasionâ€”like planning a party or a week's worth of meals. The application then scours the web to find the best prices, saving users both time and money.

Built entirely on the Google Cloud ecosystem, the project utilizes Firebase for its robust backend, hosting, and authentication, and integrates Google's Gemini API for its core intelligence. SnapShop AI demonstrates a practical and scalable solution to a universal problem, showcasing how generative AI can create a more efficient, personalized, and enjoyable shopping journey for everyone.
